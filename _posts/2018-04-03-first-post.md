title: Project Plan and First Sketches
---


The first steps I took on my website was creating a project plan. I decided I wanted to make a portfolio site that I could use to show my work to potential employers in an interesting format that showed my capabilities with web design.

I first started creating some preliminary designs. My first idea had 4 main pages - home, about me, projects, and contact - situated around the 4 edges of the page. Within "projects" there was 9 images of projects I've done, which are clickable to new pages that go in detail about the projects.

I asked for feedback about the first design, and I was told that the navigation was confusing, so I tried to create another design with a more intuitive navigation. For this one, I used 4 circles on the top left corner of the page that, when hovered over, would display the name of the page. For the project page on this site, I tried to think of a different way of displaying photos. This time I designed a page where one project would take up the whole screen at a time, and there were arrow buttons at the side where the user could navigate to other project pages.

This sketch took on the carousel-type display I used in an earlier sketch, and paired it with different elements, like lowered opacity and the overlaid text of "about" and "projects". I liked the home page I designed here.

With this sketch, I took a different approach to displaying my work. On the left page, each of the names of the projects will be displayed, and when the user hovers on them, the name will be underlined and an image appears on the right. By clicking on the name of the project, the user is directed to a seperate page for that project, which has images and text placed together that the user can reveal by scrolling down.

My next steps for this project are to photograph some of my work so I can use it in my portfolio, to figure out who I can ask for feedback as a user, and to decide on KPIs. I also want to think more about what kind of interactions I will include in the webpage (for example, when the user hovers on a project name and the image appears).
