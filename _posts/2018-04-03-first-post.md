title: Project Plan and First Sketches
---


The first steps I took on my website was creating a project plan. I decided I wanted to make a portfolio site that I could use to show my work to potential employers in an interesting format that showed my capabilities with web design. 

I first started creating some preliminary designs. My first idea had 4 main pages - home, about me, projects, and contact - situated around the 4 edges of the page. Within "projects" there was 9 images of projects I've done, which are clickable to new pages that go in detail about the projects.

I asked for feedback about the first design, and I was told that the navigation was confusing, so I tried to create another design with a more intuitive navigation. For this one, I used 4 circles on the top left corner of the page that, when hovered over, would display the name of the page. For the project page on this site, I tried to think of a different way of displaying photos. This time I designed a page where one project would take up the whole screen at a time, and there were arrow buttons at the side where the user could navigate to other project pages.

My first steps for this project are to photograph some of my work so I can use it in my portfolio, to figure out who I can ask for feedback as a user, and to decide on KPIs.
