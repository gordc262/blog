Finalizing Design
---

After I made several design sketches, I decided to pick one design to move forward with and make a more fleshed out design.

This site uses elements from the earlier sketches I made. I still have 4 main pages: the homepage, the about page, the works page, and a contact page. I'm not sure if I want to keep the contact page, since it seems like something that could easily be combined with the about page.

The main interaction I plan on having is the eyes on the home page. I want them to move around, following the user's cursor. I have no idea how I would go about doing this, so it will be a challenge for me.

To prevent the people I want to test this from looking at my portfolio site and judge the content as opposed to the site itself, I plan on using placeholder images to test it before I add my own work.
