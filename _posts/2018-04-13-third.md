title: Starting to Code

This week, I started coding my website.

I have the homepage and the about page pretty much the way I wanted them — I used a simple codepen as a source for the eyes which I plan on re-writing later myself when I get more in depth with JavaScript.

The works page is almost finished, but not quite. I want to have a preview image, or maybe even a preview carousel of images, show up when the user hovered over the name of the project, but I haven't figured that out yet. I also may still move around things on the individual project page.

The website right now is serviceable, for the most part, but not too exciting and doesn't have many interactions. I plan to come up with an idea of how I want to utilize more interactions, like text moving or changing slightly on hover, and figure out how to implement them. 

I also need to think more about responsive design — right now the website doesn't make any sense on mobile or on smaller screens.
