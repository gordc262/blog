title: Finishing Coding and Troubleshooting
---

This week I started adding content to my website, since I knew it would take a while. I accidentally added a file too large for Github to handle, which caused the site to not be able to push, and had to spend a lot of time troubleshooting that.

I also worked on making the site responsive so that it would still look good on smaller screens. I designed a simple layout for a mobile site.

Right now I need to decide if I can try to use media queries to create this website or if I should just create a whole new redirect site.
