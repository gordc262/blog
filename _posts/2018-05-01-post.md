title: Coding Mobile Site
---

Last week I finished up all the pages for my individual projects. Because image sizes were different, I ended up not using a unified design for all of them but instead layed them out to work with the images I had.

This week, I'm finishing coding a mobile version of my site. After I get that done, I need to test my website again, and get feedback on the new changes.
