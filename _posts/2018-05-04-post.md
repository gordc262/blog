title: Last Week of Work
---

This week is our last week to put the finishing touches on our websites before we have our final critiques next week. I had finished the first iteration of my mobile version by Tuesday, so I started sending it to users who could test it and give me feedback.

One of the most significant pieces of feedback I got was about the "works" page on the desktop version, something I had been thinking about before but put to the side while I worked on other parts of my website. Users said that it seemed empty and was somewhat confusing. My next steps are going to be to think of a better way I can lay out this page to make it more interesting. One thought I had was to put a carousel of images of my work on the right side of the page that disappears on hover.

Some more feedback I got was that it was cumbersome to click back every time they wanted to look at another work. Many portfolios have all their work on one page that the user can just scroll through. In order to combat this, I added arrows on the bottom of the pages that lead to the next and previous items in my list.

In the last few days I will be smoothing out the website and code and testing it on different screens to make sure it looks good and functions well on other devices.
